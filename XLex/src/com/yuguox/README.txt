1. This project has three most important classes: RegexChecker, RegexConverter, and Automata.
2. RegexChecker verifies if those given regular expressions are well-formed under the canonical definition.
3. RegexConverter will convert non-basic RE to basic.
4. Finally an automata is built in Automata, which contains a transition table.
5. This project now is in its first version, still very simple, some new classes and functions will be added soon.
6. This lexer only support letters and digits' recognition, next version all ascii characters will be supported.
7. Thanks for reading !
